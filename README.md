# KexPerformance

Running **parsingNode** parses the logs and gives results on performance tests.

The other files in the **src** folder are mainly for building transactions on the cardano testnet and require a directory with a working testnet node.

The **my_keys** folder contain addresses on the cardano testnet that can store and transfer ADA.
